# ChatBot Interface — React Frontend

A modern and responsive chat interface built using React.js, designed as a foundation for developing interactive chatbot applications. This project showcases clean component architecture, real-time message rendering, and streamlined user input handling, forming a strong base for integrating AI-powered conversational systems.

## Overview

The application demonstrates how to structure a scalable chat UI with reusable components and mock conversation data. While it currently functions as a frontend prototype, it is intentionally engineered to support future enhancements such as natural language processing, backend integration, and automated response generation.

# ChatBot Interface — React Frontend

A modern and responsive chat interface built using React.js, designed as a foundation for developing interactive chatbot applications. This project showcases clean component architecture, real-time message rendering, and streamlined user input handling, forming a strong base for integrating AI-powered conversational systems.

## Overview

The application demonstrates how to structure a scalable chat UI with reusable components and mock conversation data. While it currently functions as a frontend prototype, it is intentionally engineered to support future enhancements such as natural language processing, backend integration, and automated response generation.

## Highlights

- **Modular Component Architecture**  
  Built using clearly separated components for message rendering, input capture, and chat state management.

- **Dynamic Message History**  
  The ChatBox component manages and displays the evolving conversation in real time.

- **Responsive Interface**  
  Styled with CSS for optimal usability across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

- **Reusable Message Display**  
  A customizable Message component presents both user and system messages in a standardized layout.

- **Structured Input Logic**  
  The Input component collects user messages and triggers the submission workflow, ready to connect with a chatbot engine.

- **Chatbot Response Integration**  
  Implemented chatbot replies using response logic derived from [SuperSimpleDev's](https://unpkg.com/supersimpledev@8.6.4/chatbot.js) chatbot project and imported into this application.

## Technology Stack

- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS
- HTML

## Running the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Madhankannan02/ChatBot-React-Project.git
cd ChatBot-React-Project
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Future Enhancements

This interface is engineered to support deeper chatbot functionality. Planned upgrades may include:

- Integration with conversational AI (OpenAI, Gemini, Rasa, or custom NLP models).
- Backend service for persistent chat history.
- Typing indicators, message timestamps, and enhanced UI effects.
- User authentication and multi-session conversations.

## Purpose

This project serves as a demonstration of front-end architecture and UI engineering for chat-based applications. It is intended for portfolio presentation and showcases proficiency in component-based development, state management, and responsive design.
